# How To Play:

Requires two xbox controllers

## Movement
 Movement is locked to a grid, and requires precise inputs. Using the d pad is recommended. The movement
of both players is restricted to panels that share their color. 
Player 1 can only move on red panels while player 2 can only move on blue panels.

## Energy
 Most actions require the use of energy(the blue bar located at the bottom right and left of the screen).
Energy regenerates over time, however it can also be gained by destroying enemy blocks.

## Panel Stealing 
 You can change the color of an opponent panel to your own by spending energy to steal a panel.
Simply hold the panel steal button and then pressa the direction of the enemy panel you want to steal. 
THIS COSTS THREE BARS OF ENERGY

## Block Placement
 To place a block hold one of the tower select buttons down and then input the direction
you want to build in. The direction a block faces depends on the direction your character is facing. 
To change the direction a block is facing,rotate your character to face the desired direction.The energy spent
in order to build a block varies based on its type. You can refer to the energy bar at the bottom corners of
screen for block costs.

## Block Deletion 
 To delete a block, hold the block deletion button, and then pick the direction of the block you
wish to delete. You do not gain energy back from deleting.

## Block Upgrades 
 To upgrade a block, simply build another block on top of it. If a block of a different type is placed 
on to another, the two blocks will merge their abilities into one. The only exception is white or special blocks.
These cannot be upgraded. The cost to upgrade is the same as the cost to place.

## Stunned 
 Players can be stunned by certain attacks leaving them unable to move for a certain period of time. The time
varies based on the attack that caused the stun. You can tell you're stunned if you are flashing yellow.

## Knockback 
 Certain attacks can knock a player back a panel. Getting knocked back will also stun the player. If a block
is on the panel a player would've been knocked back into, the player will run into the block behind them and damage the
block.

## Blaster 
 You can always attack yoour opponent by using your blaster. The blaster can also be charged by holding the fire 
button down for about a second. A charge shot will deal knockback to the player hit

## Block Merging 
  Holding the interact button while facing a block will give the player a new ability. Each blocks merged 
ability is different however they all use an alternate ammo type that can be activated using the interact button.
No blocks can be merged with while a player is already merged. Special (white) blocks cannot be merged with.

## Overdrive 
 Each player has the ability to activate overdrive mode. Upon activation, all panels that were once stolen
are given back to the player, and for a short while placing blocks will not cost energy. The amount of time overdrive
lasts depends on the amount of health a player has. The lower the health, the longer the effect. 
This can only be used once per game.

# Block Merge Abilities:

## Laser Block
 The player can use projectiles that intelligently find the opponents location, and travels there. They
also avoid abstacles along the way.

## Orbiter Block 
 The player can cast lightening to stun the opponent.

## Ramming Block 
 Hold LB to charge, then release to dash towards the opponent. 
You'll bounce back and forth whenever you hit a block or a player; damaging whatever you run into. 
If you travel out of bounds or hit one of the cores the dash will be canceled. You can also cancel by pressing LB.

## Defense Block 
 Gives the player the ability to summon a energy barrier around them that can reflect incoming projectiles.
The barrier will be up as long as LB is held.

## Kinetic Block 
 Press LB to fire a kinetic bomb. The range and power of this bomb increases based on the amount of enemy
projectiles it has absorbed. Press LB again while the bomb is active to detonate it. 

## Repair Block 
 Press and hold LB to repair blocks in front of you. If a block is healed beyond its current health maximum it will be upgraded to the next level.

## Material/Energy Block 
 The player can fire paralyzing rounds that stun the opponent while also stealing some energy.

 ## Factory Block 
 The player gains the ability to place blocks on the opponents side. A block transporter will appear over the players head. Press LB to make the block transporter travel to the opponents side. Once the block is over the panel use want to place it, press the LB button again to drop the block on that panel. If the panel below the block is at maximum capacity or if the opponent is there the dropped block will explode on impact. Press any of the block switching buttons to switch the block the transporter is carrying.

Any block not in this list does not have a merge ability. Merging with a block with no ability will cause a bug that
prevents the player from merging again.
